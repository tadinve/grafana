# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include the Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv’s dependency resolution may lead to different
#   Pipfile.lock files between Windows and Unix/MacOS platforms. Thus, it might be a good idea
#   to include the lock file in .gitignore as well.
